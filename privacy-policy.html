<h1>IRON MIND – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 16, 2026</em></p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
IRON MIND is designed with privacy in mind. Your favorites, custom quotes, streak data,
and notification settings are stored locally on your device. We do not require an account
and we do not store your content on our servers.
</p>

<h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
<p>
The app uses on-device storage to save your preferences and content.
This data stays on your device unless you remove it (for example by uninstalling the app).
</p>

<h2>3. Notifications</h2>
<p>
If you enable notifications, the app will request permission to send notifications.
By default, IRON MIND uses local scheduled notifications generated on your device.
We do not receive your notification settings.
</p>
<p>
If a future version adds push notifications delivered via Apple services,
device tokens may be processed solely for delivering notifications.
</p>

<h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
If you purchase a subscription, payments are processed by Apple App Store.
We do not receive your full payment details.
Apple may process purchase-related data according to its own privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>5. Analytics</h2>
<p>
We do not use third-party analytics tools and we do not track your behavior across apps or websites.
</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
We do not sell your personal data. Depending on enabled features,
certain platform services (such as Apple purchase processing and notification delivery)
may process limited technical information to provide their services.
</p>
<p>
Apple may independently collect certain technical or transactional data as part of
providing its platform services (such as app downloads, subscription processing, or crash reporting).
We do not control how Apple processes such information.
</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided personal data,
please contact us.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
Uninstalling the app will remove most locally stored data from your device.
We do not store your data on external servers, so there is no server-side deletion request needed.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
We will update the "Last updated" date and show the updated policy in the app.
</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>

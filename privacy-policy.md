# IRON MIND – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 16, 2026_

## 1. Data Collection
IRON MIND is designed with privacy in mind. Your favorites, custom quotes, streak data, and notification settings are stored locally on your device. We do not require an account and we do not store your content on our servers.

## 2. Local Storage
The app uses on-device storage to save your preferences and content. This data stays on your device unless you remove it (for example by uninstalling the app).

## 3. Notifications
If you enable notifications, the app will request permission to send notifications. By default, IRON MIND uses local scheduled notifications generated on your device. We do not receive your notification settings.

(Note: If a future version adds push notifications delivered via Apple/Google services, device tokens may be processed only for delivering notifications.)

## 4. In-App Purchases
If you purchase a subscription, payments are processed by Apple App Store or Google Play. We do not receive your full payment details. Apple/Google may process purchase-related data according to their own privacy policies.

## 5. Analytics
We do not use third-party analytics tools and we do not track your behavior across apps or websites.

## 6. Third-Party Services
We do not sell your personal data. Depending on enabled features, certain platform services (such as Apple/Google purchase processing and notification delivery) may process limited technical information to provide their services.

Platform Data Disclosure: Apple and Google may independently collect certain technical or transactional data as part of providing their platform services (such as app downloads, subscription processing, or crash reporting). We do not control how these platforms process such information.

## 7. Children's Privacy
The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided personal data, contact us.

## 8. Data Deletion
Uninstalling the app will remove most locally stored data from your device. We do not store your data on external servers, so there is no server-side deletion request needed.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date and show the updated policy in the app.
